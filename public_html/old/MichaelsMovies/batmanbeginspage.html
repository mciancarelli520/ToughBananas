        <p>Batman Begins is a 2005 superhero film based on the  fictional DC Comics character Batman, co-written and directed by Christopher  Nolan and starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes,  Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, and Morgan  Freeman. The film reboots the Batman film series, telling the origin story of  the title character (Bale), from his alter ego Bruce Wayne's initial fear of  bats, the death of his parents, his journey to become Batman, and his fight to  stop Ra's al Ghul (Watanabe) and the Scarecrow (Murphy) from plunging Gotham  City into chaos. It draws inspiration from classic comic book storylines such  as The Man Who Falls, Batman: Year One, and Batman: The Long Halloween.</p>
        <p>After a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect Batman  on screen following the critical failure and box office disappointment of  Batman &amp; Robin (1997), Nolan and David S. Goyer began to work on the film  in early 2003 and aimed for a darker and more realistic tone, with humanity and  realism being the basis of the film. The goal was to get the audience to care  for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. The film, which was primarily shot in Iceland  and Chicago, relied on traditional stunts and miniatures, while  computer-generated imagery was used minimally.</p>
        <p>Batman Begins opened on June 15, 2005, in the United States  and Canada in 3,858 theaters. It grossed over $48 million in its opening  weekend in North America, eventually grossing over $374 million worldwide. The  film received positive reviews and is considered by many to be one of the best  superhero films of its decade. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for  Best Cinematography and three BAFTA awards. It is followed by The Dark Knight  (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012) in a continual story-arc, which has  later been referred to as The Dark Knight Trilogy.      </p>
        <h2>The Plot</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a child, Bruce Wayne falls down a dry well and is  attacked by a swarm of bats, subsequently developing a fear of bats. While  watching an opera with his parents, Bruce becomes frightened by performers  masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger Joe Chill murders  Bruce's parents in front of him. Orphaned, Bruce is raised by the family  butler, Alfred Pennyworth.</p>
        <p>Fourteen years later, Chill is freed in exchange for  testifying against Gotham City mafia boss Carmine Falcone. Bruce intends to  murder Chill in revenge, but one of Falcone's assassins does so first. Bruce's  childhood friend, assistant district attorney Rachel Dawes, berates him for  attempting to undermine the justice system, saying that his father would be  ashamed. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that real power comes from  being feared. Bruce decides to travel the world, learning new skills and  abilities to confront injustice. In Ladakh he meets Henri Ducard, who trains  him as a member of the League of Shadows, led by Ra's al Ghul. After completing  his training and purging his fears, Bruce learns that the League intends to  destroy Gotham, believing it to be corrupt and beyond saving. Bruce rejects the  League's cause and burns down their temple during his escape. Ra's is killed by  falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard.</p>
        <p><br>
          Bruce returns to Gotham intent on fighting crime. Inspired  by his childhood fear, he takes up the vigilante identity of &quot;the  Batman&quot; and sets up a base in the caves beneath Wayne Manor. He takes an  interest in his family's company, Wayne Enterprises, now run by the  unscrupulous William Earle. Company archivist Lucius Fox allows Bruce access to  prototype defense technologies including a protective bodysuit and a heavily  armored car called the Tumbler. To avert suspicion from his vigilante  activities, Bruce poses as a shallow playboy.</p>
        <p><br>
          Batman intercepts a drug shipment, provides Rachel with  evidence against Falcone, and enlists honest Police Sergeant James Gordon to  arrest him. When Falcone threatens to reveal psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane's  illicit activities if Crane does not declare him mentally unfit for trial,  Crane uses a fear-inducing hallucinogen and a scarecrow mask to drive Falcone  insane and has him transferred to Arkham Asylum. While investigating &quot;the  Scarecrow&quot;, Batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated.  He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox.</p>
        <p><br>
          When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, Crane reveals that  he has been pouring his fear-inducing drug into Gotham's water supply. He doses  Rachel with it, but Batman saves her and subdues Crane, who claims to work for  Ra's al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety, administers the  antidote, and gives her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass  production. Ducard reappears at Bruce's 30th birthday party and reveals himself  to be the actual Ra's al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from  Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering  Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He  sets Wayne Manor on fire and leaves Bruce for dead, but Alfred rescues Bruce.</p>
        <p><br>
          Ra's loads the microwave emitter onto Gotham's monorail  system, releasing the drug as the train travels toward the city's central water  source. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and indirectly reveals his  identity to her. He pursues Ra's onto the monorail and overpowers him just as  Gordon uses the Tumbler's cannons to destroy a section of the track. Batman  refuses to kill Ra's but also chooses not to save him, gliding from the train  and leaving Ra's aboard as it crashes and explodes.<br>
          Bruce gains Rachel's respect but loses her love, as she  decides she cannot be with him while he is Batman. Bruce buys a controlling  stake in the now publicly traded Wayne Enterprises, fires Earle, and replaces  him with Fox. Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant of the Gotham City Police  Department, shows Batman the Bat-Signal, and mentions a criminal who leaves  Joker playing cards at crime scenes. Batman promises to investigate.</p>
