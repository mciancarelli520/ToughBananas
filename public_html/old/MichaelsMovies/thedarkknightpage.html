        <p>The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced,  and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman,  the film is the second part of Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and a sequel to  2005's Batman Begins, starring an ensemble cast including Christian Bale,  Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and  Morgan Freeman. In the film, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Bale), James Gordon (Oldman)  and Harvey Dent (Eckhart) form an alliance to dismantle organized crime in  Gotham City, but are menaced by a criminal mastermind known as the Joker who  seeks to undermine Batman's influence and create chaos.</p>
        <p>Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book  debut in 1940, the 1988 graphic novel The Killing Joke, and the 1996 series The  Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname &quot;the Dark  Knight&quot; was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story  written by Bill Finger. The Dark Knight was filmed primarily in Chicago, as  well as in several other locations in the United States, the United Kingdom,  and Hong Kong. Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences,  including the Joker's first appearance in the film. The film is dedicated to  Heath Ledger, who died on January 22, 2008, some months after the completed  filming and six months before the film's release, from a toxic combination of  prescription drugs, leading to intense attention from the press and movie-going  public. Warner Bros. initially created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark  Knight, developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screenshots  of Ledger as the Joker.</p>
        <p>A co-production of the United States and the United Kingdom,  The Dark Knight was released on July 16, 2008 in Australia, on July 18, 2008 in  North America, and on July 24, 2008 in the United Kingdom. Considered by film  critics to be one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the best superhero  films ever, the film received highly positive reviews and set numerous records  during its theatrical run. The Dark Knight appeared on more critics' top ten lists  than any other film of 2008 with the exception of WALL-E, and more critics named  The Dark Knight the best film of 2008 than any other film released that year.  With over $1 billion in revenue worldwide, it is the 24th-highest-grossing film  of all time, unadjusted for inflation. The film received eight Academy Award  nominations; it won the award for Best Sound Editing and Ledger was  posthumously awarded Best Supporting Actor. The Dark Knight Rises, the final  film in the trilogy, was released on July 20, 2012.</p>

        <h2>The Plot        </h2>
        <p>A gang of criminals rob a Gotham City mob bank,  double-crossing and murdering each other until there is only one left: The  Joker, who escapes with the money.</p>
        <p>Batman, District Attorney Harvey Dent and Lieutenant Jim  Gordon form an alliance to rid Gotham of organized crime. Bruce Wayne is  impressed with Dent's idealism and offers to support his career; he believes  that, with Dent as Gotham's protector, he can give up being Batman and lead a  normal life with Rachel Dawesâ€”even though she and Dent are dating.</p>
        <p>Mob bosses Sal Maroni, Gambol and the Chechen hold a  videoconference with corrupt accountant Lau, who has taken their funds and fled  to Hong Kong. The Joker interrupts, warns them that Batman is unhindered by the  law, and offers to kill him in exchange for half of their money. Gambol puts a  bounty on the Joker, but the Joker kills him instead and takes over his gang.  The mob ultimately decides to take the Joker up on his offer.</p>
        <p>Dent arrests the entire mob, while Batman finds Lau in Hong  Kong and brings him back to Gotham to testify against them. The Joker threatens  to keep killing people unless Batman reveals his identity, and starts by  murdering Police Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and the judge presiding over the  mob trial. The Joker also tries to kill Mayor Anthony Garcia, but Gordon  sacrifices himself to stop the assassination. Dent learns that Rachel is the  next target.</p>
        <p>Bruce decides to reveal his secret identity. Before he can,  however, Dent announces that he is Batman. Dent is taken into protective  custody, but the Joker appears and attacks the convoy. Batman comes to Dent's  rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, arrests the Joker and is promoted to  Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by policemen on the mob's  payroll. Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that Rachel and Dent have  been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives. Batman races to save  Rachel, while Gordon goes to save Dent. Batman arrives at the building,  realizing that the Joker sent him to Dent's location instead. Both buildings  explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring half of Dent's face. The Joker escapes  the jail with Lau.</p>
        <p>Coleman Reese, an accountant at Wayne Enterprises, deduces  that Bruce is Batman and tries to go public with the information. The Joker  sets fire to the mob's money - burning Lau alive in the process - and kills the  Chechen. He then threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills Reese.  Gordon orders the evacuation of all the hospitals in Gotham and goes to secure  Reese. The Joker finds Dent in a hospital and manipulates him into seeking  revenge for Rachel's death. He destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload  of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree, targeting people he holds  responsible for Rachel's death, including Maroni and the two cops who kidnapped  Rachel.</p>
        <p>The Joker rigs two ferries with explosives; one containing  civilians and the other containing prisoners. He says that he will blow them  both up by midnight, but will let one live if it blows up the other. Batman  finds the Joker with a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the  reluctant help of Lucius Fox. The passengers refuse to kill each other, and  Batman apprehends the Joker after a fight. Before the police arrive to take the  Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's  rampage becomes public knowledge.</p>
        <p>Gordon arrives at the building where Rachel died, where Dent  judges his fate, along with his own and Batman's, by flipping a coin. He spares  himself, shoots Batman, and tries to kill Gordon's son. Batman, who was wearing  body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon  to preserve Dent's heroic image by holding Batman responsible for the murders.  As the police launch a manhunt for Batman, Gordon destroys the Bat-signal, Fox  watches as the sonar device self-destructs, and Alfred Pennyworth burns a  letter from Rachel saying she is going to marry Dent.</p>
