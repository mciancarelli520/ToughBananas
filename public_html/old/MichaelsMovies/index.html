        <h1>Welcome to Cinema Nation!        </h1>
        <h2>What is Cinema Nation?</h2>
        <p>Cinema Nation is a group project that started in 2013 as a small website for streaming projects and mini-movies from users across the globe. After a major sponser provided by IMDB, Cinema Nation is now a movie streaming website providing free movie streaming. The selection of movies changes every month, ranging from movie sagas to movie genre colleges, providing a constant flow of entertainment to everyone who shows interest in the theme. While Cinema Nation is a 24/7 running website showing free movies, we appreciate any provided donations towards new selections and movies released the same week as most major retail stores and redbox. </p>
        <h2>What is our goal?</h2>
        <p>Our Long-Term goal is to provide viewers new selections of movies for no charge, allowing our audience to be entertained by movies chosen by the viewers, for the viewers. After a vote has been created, the said movie series will be shown the next month.   Movies can be chosen from sagas, series, and more. Ranging from the Harry Potter series, to a Quentin Tarantino Movie Collection, to the X-Men series, and more!</p>
        <h2>How can you help?</h2>
        <p>Cinema Nation does not require any method of payment, but an account is required in order to enjoy our movies. After signing up, you can watch the selected movies. Anytime during the movie, if you decide that you would like to donate, there is a Donate button located below the video. Donations are not required, but are greatly appreciated.        </p>
