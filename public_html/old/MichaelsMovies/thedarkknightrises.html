        <p>The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 British-American superhero  film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his  brother Jonathan Nolan, and the story with David S. Goyer. Featuring the DC  Comics character Batman, the film is the final installment in Nolan's Batman  film trilogy, and the sequel to Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight  (2008). Christian Bale reprises the lead role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, with a  returning cast of allies: Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as  James Gordon, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. The film introduces Selina Kyle  (Anne Hathaway), and Bane (Tom Hardy). Eight years after the events of The Dark  Knight, violent revolutionary Bane forces an older Bruce Wayne to resume his  role as Batman and save Gotham City from nuclear destruction.</p>
        <p>Christopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series  for a second time, but agreed after developing a story with his brother and  Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Nolan drew  inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 &quot;Knightfall&quot;  storyline, the 1986 series The Dark Knight Returns, and the 1999 storyline  &quot;No Man's Land&quot;. Filming took place in locations including Jodhpur,  London, Nottingham, Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, and  Pittsburgh. Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras for much of the filming,  including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the  picture. A vehicle variation of the Batplane and Batcopter termed the  &quot;Bat&quot;, an underground prison set, and a new Batcave set were created  specifically for the film. As with The Dark Knight, viral marketing campaigns  began early during production. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused  its campaign: developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes  of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information  regarding the film's plot.</p>
        <p>The Dark Knight Rises premiered in New York City on July 16,  2012. The film was released in Australia and New Zealand on July 19, 2012, and  in North America and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012. It received positive  reviews from critics, many of whom named it one of the best films of 2012. Like  its predecessor, the film grossed over $1 billion worldwide at the box office, making  it the second film in the Batman film series to earn $1 billion. It is  currently the 16th-highest-grossing film of all time, the  third-highest-grossing film of 2012, and the fourth-highest-grossing superhero  film of all time.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
        <h2>The Plot</h2>
        <p>Eight years after the death of district attorney Harvey Dent  (The Dark Knight), the Dent Act grants the Gotham City Police Department powers  which nearly eradicate organized crime. Police Commissioner James Gordon (Gary  Oldman) feels increasingly guilty for covering up the crimes committed by Dent,  who was groomed into a murderer by the Joker. He writes a resignation speech  confessing the truth but decides not to use it.</p>
        <p>Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a recluse, broken by  the death of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and has retired as Batman after  taking blame for Dent's crimes. Cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) obtains  Bruce's fingerprints from his home and kidnaps congressman Byron Gilley (Brett  Cullen). She hands the fingerprints to Phillip Stryver (Burn Gorman), an  assistant to Bruce's business rival John Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn). In return,  she asks him to have her criminal record erased. Stryver double-crosses Selina,  but she uses Gilley's phone to alert the police to their location. Gordon and  the police arrive to find the congressman, and then pursue Stryver's men into  the sewers while Selina flees.</p>
        <p>Bane (Tom Hardy), a masked mercenary, captures Gordon and  finds his resignation speech. Gordon escapes and is found by John Blake (Joseph  Gordon-Levitt), a patrol officer. Gordon promotes Blake to detective, with  Blake reporting directly to him. Bane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange, using  Bruce's fingerprints in a transaction that bankrupts Bruce. Alfred Pennyworth  (Michael Caine) reveals that Rachel had intended to marry Dent before she died.  Alfred then resigns in an attempt to convince Bruce to move on from being  Batman.</p>
        <p>Wayne Enterprises is unprofitable after Bruce discontinued  his fusion reactor project when he learned that the core could be weaponized.  Fearing that Daggett, Bane's employer, would gain access to the reactor, Bruce  asks Wayne Enterprises board member Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) to take  over his company. Catwoman agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him  into Bane's trap. Bane reveals that he intends to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's (Liam  Neeson) mission to destroy Gotham (Batman Begins) with the League of Shadows  remnant. He engages Batman and delivers a crippling blow to his back, before  taking him to a foreign, well-like prison where escape is virtually impossible.  There, the inmates tell Bruce the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, born in the  prison and cared for by a fellow prisoner before escaping—the only prisoner to  have ever done so. Bruce assumes the child to be Bane.</p>
        <p>Bane lures Gotham police underground and traps them there.  He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia (Nestor Carbonell) and forces Dr. Leonid Pavel  (Alon Abutbul), a Russian nuclear physicist he kidnapped from Uzbekistan six  months prior, to convert the reactor core into a nuclear bomb. Bane uses the  bomb to hold the city hostage and isolate Gotham from the world. Using Gordon's  stolen speech, Bane reveals the cover-up of Dent's crimes and releases the  prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary, initiating anarchy. The wealthy and  powerful have their property expropriated, are dragged from their homes, and  are given show trials presided over by Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy),  where all are sentenced to death.</p>
        <p>After spending months recovering and re-training, Bruce  escapes from the prison. He enlists Selina, Blake, Tate, Gordon, and Lucius Fox  (Morgan Freeman) to help stop the bomb's detonation. He hands the Batpod to  Selina, tasking her with helping people evacuate and saving herself. She asks  him to come along, leaving Gotham to its fate, but he refuses. While the police  and Bane's forces clash, Batman overpowers Bane. He interrogates Bane for the  bomb's trigger, but Tate intervenes and stabs him. She reveals herself to be  Talia al Ghul, Ra's al Ghul's daughter. Bane is her protector, who aided her  escape from the prison. She uses the detonator, but Gordon has successfully  approached the bomb and blocks her signal, preventing remote detonation. Talia  leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Selina returns  on the Batpod and kills Bane. Batman and Kyle pursue Talia, hoping to bring the  bomb back to the reactor where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but  she remotely destroys the reactor before dying. With no way to stop the  detonation, Batman uses the Bat to haul the bomb over the bay, where it  detonates.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and is honored as  a hero. With Bruce Wayne also presumed dead, Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage,  and Bruce's remaining estate is left to Alfred. Fox discovers that Bruce had  fixed the Bat's autopilot, Gordon finds the Bat-Signal refurbished and Alfred  sees Bruce and Selina together while visiting Florence. John Blake resigns from  the police force and inherits the Batcave.</p>
